        <p>Hi! This website was made as a portfolio project, to learn Angular and practice with Typescript. 
            It also uses some Material Design buttons/icons/switches, and TailwindCSS for styling.
            <br/><br/>
            It shows rain data and traffic data worldwide, 
            and train disruptions for the <strong>Dutch railways</strong>, all at once. (I'll admit it's a bit random, thinking of practice projects can be a challengeðŸ™ƒ)
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>How It's Made</strong><br/>
            The map is based on <a target="_blank" href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a>. 
            For the data (Leaflet tiles), I used: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the <a target="_blank" href="https://apiportal.ns.nl/apis">NS API</a> for railway disruptions, which provides GeoJSON data, allowing for custom colors, labels, popups, etc,
                </li>
                <li>
                    the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.tomtom.com/traffic-api/documentation/product-information/introduction">TOMTOM API</a> for traffic data, which gives data in PNG format (per tile, depending om zoom/location),
                </li>
                <li>
                    and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mwasil/Leaflet.Rainviewer">the Rainviewer plugin for leaflet </a> which I have no clue how it works exactly and where it gets the data from, but it works ðŸ‘Œ.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            <br/>
            The API's are all free versions, so they might run out of requests quickly 
            after which those parts will stop working (you should get a warning!) :) 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>I also had some help.. â™« ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myselfâ™«</strong>
                <br/>
            I also used a few tutorials, especially 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/creating-a-free-weather-map-with-angular-leaflet-and-the-noaa-1cd89570c4ff">this one</a> 
            by Johathan Sanders (though NOAA didnt work for Dutch Weather), 
            and to get started with Angular, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23o0evRtrFI&ab_channel=Fireship">Angular beginner tutorial</a> by Fireship. 
            And I used quite some help from co-pilot, 
            without which I would not have completed this in one week. 
            Though more on how to approach things, 
            rather than to code the whole thing.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The code is on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AleidS/angularEverythingAtOnce">github</a>, and you can use it to make your own version with your own API keys, and add whatever other data/layers you find useful!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Happy Travel planning!
            <br/><br/>

            Suggestions, questions and feedback always welcome! Especially on API's for other railway networks :) I'm planning on a code refactor, some darkmode additions and language options.
            <br/><br/>
            PS: I tried to make it so that API keys are hidden and misuse shouldn't occur, but if any API provider has complaints, please let me know so I can fix things:)
